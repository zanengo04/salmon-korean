            <p  className="doubleSpace">Learning a language is rather difficult when you first started. I have tried numerous times
            to learn Japanese but nothing seems to work out. Leveraging my experience from learning English
            and Korean. I will tell you the best way to learn Korean</p>
            <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
            <p className="doubleSpace">I know that learning vocabularies is boring. I dreaded the process of memorizing vocabularies
            every since I was in middle school. But self teaching myself Korean made me realized the importance
            of vocabularies. Afterall, they are the building blocks to any language. So here are some of the most
            basic and useful vocabularies to know for beginners.</p>

            <h2>Phrases</h2>
            <p className="doubleSpace">Learning vocabularies on its own is extremely difficult. I have done so on countless 
            occasions, trying to cram my last minute definitions down. This might be effective in storing
            that information in your short term memory but it won't do you any good if you are serious
            about learning Korea. The goal should always be solidifying everything you have learned into
            your long term memory so you can have instant access to it whenever you speak to native people.
            One of the most effect way to do so is to learn vocabularies while making phrases. This kills two birds
            in one stone as it allows you to practice making sentences, while learning the vocabularies at the same time.
            Here are some of the most commonly used Korean phrases.</p>
