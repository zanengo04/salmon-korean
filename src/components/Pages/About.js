            <p className="doubleSpace">Hi I'm Quoc. I used to live in Vietnam but I moved to America around 8 years ago.
            My language journey started when I was very young when I had to learn English as my second
            language. Being bilingual made me very confident on my ability to learn Korea. However, reality
            was far off from expectation when I had to learn everything from scratch in Korean. It was something
            that I took for granted when I was learning English. Because I got exposure to English when I was at
            a young age so the learning process was much smoother. However, with Korean, it was a different story.
            I didn't have any prior knowledge to leverage on. I didn't watch K drama or listen to Kpop before studying
            Korean, so I didn't even know how to say hello. Having overcome such a hurdle, I'm here to share my learning
            experience with you, so you can learn Korean more effectively. </p>
            
            <h2>A little bit about more myself:</h2>
            <p className="doubleSpace">I got into studying Korean very randomly. During Christmas of 2017, I went bowling by myself 
            (sounds lonely but none of my friends like to bowl so I just went to practice myself). It was very
            loud in the bowling alley, but a song that I really liked came up so I Shazamed it. I remember liking
            the song so much that I shazamed it multiple times just to make sure it was the right song. The song was
            As if it's your last by BLACKPINK. I didn't think much about it when I went home, or even when I saw their
            MV for the first time. But in March, when I was bored I watched their reality TV show and it got me interested
            in both Korean language and culture.</p>
