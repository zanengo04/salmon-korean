            <h1>To be: 이다</h1>
            <p>

            Let’s start building sentences in Korean. In this lesson, we will start by making simple sentences using the word 이다. The translation for “이다” is “to be.”  English speakers often don’t realize how difficult the word “to be” is. Depending on who is being referred to, the word “to be” could be any of the underlined words below:
            <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>I am a man</li>
                <li>He is a man</li>
                <li>They are men</li>
                <li>I was a man</li>
                <li>They were men</li>
            </ul>


            In each of those sentences, a different word (is, am, are, was, were) is used depending on the subject and tense of the sentence. I can’t imagine how difficult this would be for an English learner. In Korean, the 이다 is used to represent all of those “to be” words.
            <br/><br />
            As mentioned earlier, 이다 can be conjugated. In that way, 이다 is similar to verbs and adjectives, but the rules for 이다 are often (but not always) different. I will teach you how 이다 differs from verbs and adjectives as it becomes important in later on.
            <br /><br />
            Like adjectives, 이다 can not act on an object. Only verbs can act on objects. For example:
            <br /><br />
            I eat hamburgers (eat is a verb, the object is a hamburger)
            She meets my friend (meet is a verb, the object is my friend)
            They study Korean (study is a verb, the object is Korean)
            We listen to music (listen is a verb, the object is music)
            <br /><br />
            All of those sentences (can) have objects because the verb is the predicate of the sentence. However, in sentences that are predicated by adjectives, there will not be an object
            <br /><br />
            I am pretty
            She is beautiful
            They are hungry
            We are smart

            Look at those four sentences. When we use adjectives in English, we must also use “to be” words like am, is and are. In other words, we cannot make sentences like this:

            <ul>
                <li>I pretty</li>
                <li>She beautiful</li>
                <li>They hungry</li>
                <li>We smart</li>
            </ul>
            Unlike in English, 이다 is not used in these types of sentences. That is, we do not use 이다 to indicate that something “is” an adjective.
            <br /><br />
            So, 이다 is not used in these types of sentences:

            <ul>
                <li>I pretty</li>
                <li>She beautiful</li>
                <li>They hungry</li>
                <li>We smart</li>
            </ul>
            However, 이다 is used in these types of sentences:
            <br /><br />
            <ul>
                <li>I am a man</li>
                <li>He is a man</li>
                <li>They are men</li>
                <li>I was a man</li>
            </ul>

            이다 is used to indicate that a noun is a noun. The basic structure for a sentence predicated by “이다” is:

            [noun은/는] [another noun][이다]
            <br />
            For example:
            <br />
            I는 man이다 = I am a man
            <br />
            Now substitute the words for “man” and “I,” which are:
            <br />
            나 = I<br />
            남자 = man
            <br /><br />
            The Korean sentence would look like this:
            <br />
            나는 남자이다 = I am a man
            <br /><br />
            Notice that 이다 is attached directly to the second noun. Verbs and adjectives are not attached to nouns like this, but 이다 is. It would be incorrect to include a space between the second noun and 이다. For example, this would be incorrect:
            <br /><br />
            나는 남자 이다
            <br /><br />
            Although it might look and feel like “남자” is an object in that sentence, it is not. 이다, like adjectives and unlike verbs cannot act on an object. It would be incorrect to include the object particle on the second noun. For example, this would be incorrect:
            <br /><br />
            나는 남자를 이다</p>
