                The word 좋다 in Korean is an adjective that means “good.” Because 좋다 is an adjective we can use it just like any other adjective:
                <br /><br />
                <ul>
                    <li>이 음식은 좋다 = this food is good</li>
                    <li>그 선생님은 좋다 = that teacher is good</li>
                    <li>이 학교는 좋다 = This school is good</li>
                </ul>
                There is also 좋아하다 which is a verb meaning ‘to like.’ Because 좋아하다 is a verb, can use it just like any other verb:
                <br /><br />
                <ul>
                    <li>나는 이 음식을 좋아하다 = I like this food</li>
                    <li>나는 그 선생님을 좋아하다 = I like that teacher</li>
                </ul>
                좋아하다 gets formed by removing ‘다’ from 좋다 and adding 아 + 하다. There is a reason for why this is done, and there is an explanation for how it is done – but you do not need to know this yet. For now, just understand that:
                <br /><br />
                좋다 is an adjective which cannot act on an object
                좋아하다 is a verb which can act on an object

        </main>
    )
}
