            <h1>
            Conjugating 있다 and 있다</h1>
            <p className="doubleSpace">
            있다 is one of the most complex and versatile words in Korean. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most common words. It is often very difficult for learners of a language to fully understand some of the most commonly used words in whatever language they are studying. For example, a native English speaker might think that the word “the” is one of the easiest words as it is used so frequently. However, try explaining the meaning and purpose of “the” to a Korean person and you will quickly discover that its usage is very complex.
            <br /><br />
            있다 can be an adjective, or it can be a verb. Whether it is an adjective or a verb depends on its usage.
            <br /><br />
            있다 is an adjective when it is used to indicate that one “has” something. You learned these sentences:
            <ul>
                <li>나는 펜이 있다 = I have a pen</li>
                <li>나는 차가 있다 = I have a car</li>
                <li>나는 가방이 있다 = I have a bag</li>
            </ul>
            Because this 있다 is considered an adjective, we follow the rule for conjugating an adjective to the present tense – which is do nothing and leave the adjective the way it is. So, those three sentences above are perfectly conjugated and grammatically correct.
            <br /><br />
            When 있다 is used to indicate that something/someone is “at/in” a location, it is also an adjective. This is also very difficult for an English speaker to wrap their head around. You learned these sentences in:
            <ul>
                <li>나는 은행 안에 있다 = I am inside the bank</li>
                <li>개는 집 안에 있다 = The dog is in the house</li>
                <li>고양이는 의자 밑에 있다 = The cat is under the chair</li>
            </ul>
            Again, because this usage of 있다 is considered an adjective, we follow the rule for conjugating an adjective to the present tense – which is do nothing and leave the adjective the way it is. So, those three sentences above are perfectly conjugated in the plain form and grammatically correct.
            <br /><br />
            However, the usage of 있다 is much more complex than just these two meanings. 있다 has many usages. In fact, there are times when 있다 is considered a verb. At this point, your understanding of Korean is not strong enough to see example sentences of 있다 as a verb because you haven’t learned some critical grammatical principles yet. What I want you to take from this is that 있다 can be a verb – and thus – is conjugated as a verb sometimes. Therefore, although the example sentences above with 있다 are properly conjugated, there are times when the proper conjugation of 있다 in the “plain form” would be 있는다.
            <br /><br />
            있다 is considered a verb when a person (or animal) is not only “at” a location, but “staying” at a location or in a state for a period of time. The difference between the adjective “있다” (to indicate something/someone is at a location) and the verb “있다” (to indicate that someone stays at a location or in a state) is confusing.
